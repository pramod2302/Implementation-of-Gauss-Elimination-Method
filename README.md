# Implementation-of-Gauss-Elimination-Method

The code ge.c solves the system of equation specified in the input.txt file and returns the coefficient values. 

*** Input Data ***

The input matrix in the file input.txt should be of the order [ n * (n+1) ]. 

where n columns are the powers of x value ranging from (x ^ (n-1) to x ^ 0)  and the (n+1)th column is the corresponding y value

similarly there should be n such rows with different (x , y) pairs.

*** How to run the code ***

compile the code using. "cc ge.c"

execute the code using "./a.out input.txt"
